K-Means Clustering – Theoretical Overview
1. Objective:
K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition data into distinct groups (clusters) based on similarity. It aims to group data such that data points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

Key Concepts:
2. Features for Clustering:
Clustering is performed on numerical features that represent meaningful dimensions for grouping. In customer segmentation, common features might include income, spending behavior, or purchase history.

3. Standardization (Feature Scaling):
Because K-Means uses Euclidean distance to measure similarity, it is sensitive to the scale of input features. Features are often scaled to have zero mean and unit variance to ensure no single feature dominates the distance metric.

4. Choosing the Number of Clusters (k):
The Elbow Method is commonly used to determine the optimal number of clusters. It involves plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against different values of k. The "elbow" point on the plot—where the rate of decrease sharply changes—suggests a good value for k.

5. Clustering Process:
K-Means works iteratively through:

Randomly initializing cluster centers (centroids)

Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid

Updating centroids based on the mean of points in each cluster

Repeating until assignments stabilize

6. Cluster Assignment:
Once the algorithm converges, each data point is assigned a label corresponding to its cluster. These labels represent group membership.

7. Visualization:
Clusters can be visualized using scatter plots for two-dimensional data. Different colors represent different clusters, allowing us to see how the data is segmented.

Applications:
K-Means is widely used in:

Customer segmentation

Market research

Image compression

Anomaly detection
